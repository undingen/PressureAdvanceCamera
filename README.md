# Pressure Advance Camera Calibration for Klipper

This project introduces a tool to automatically calibrate the **pressure advance** setting for FDM 3D printers running the **Klipper firmware** using a low cost USB (endoscope) **camera** üì∏ and computer vision. Pressure advance is a key feature in Klipper that enhances print quality by fine-tuning extruder behavior during acceleration and deceleration. By leveraging a camera to analyze a test pattern before each print, this tool simplifies and automates the calibration process, saving time and effort for users.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

üöß Early development version - verify results manually. Not responsible for damage. Test in safe environment first.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automated Calibration:** Prints and captures a test pattern with a camera and determines the optimal pressure advance value.
- **Affordable Hardware:** Uses a low-cost USB endoscope camera (around ‚Ç¨6) for image capture.
- **Open Source:** Licensed under **GPL3** which allows even commercial use, welcoming community contributions and modifications.

## ü§ñ How It Works

1. **Test Pattern Creation:**
   - At the start of a print, the printer draws a series of lines with varying pressure advance values.
2. **Image Capture:**
   - The camera moves to the center of the test pattern takes a picture of it.
3. **Image Analysis:**
   - The image is processed using the open BirefNet model via the fal.ai API, which removes the background (build-plate) - I hope to get rid of this step in the future and run a small local model instead but until now this is required.
   - We identify the rectangle drawn in the pattern and crop it and fix the horrible lens distortion the cheap camera introduces.
   - Afterwards we identify the smoothest and most continuous line using OpenCV Computer Vision algorithms.
4. **Calibration Application:**
   - The software sets the optimal pressure advance value, and the printer continues the print with this setting.

## Requirements

- **Camera:**
   - A **cheap USB endoscope camera** (approximately ‚Ç¨5). Ensure it is **full HD** and has a **flexible cable** (they also sell a semi-solid one which likely cause problems). Theoretical a webcam could also work if it can focus on something about 10cm away. [Here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006521256206.html) is the one I bought.
- **Mounting:**
   - The camera must be securely mounted on the printhead, facing straight down. [Here](https://www.printables.com/model/1233276-8mm-endoscope-camera-mount-using-existing-bltouch) you can find the mount I use which reuses the existing BLTouch mount
- **free USB Port**
- **Klipper and ssh access**

## üöÄ Setup

### Hardware Setup

1. **Mount the Camera:**
   - Attach a USB endoscope camera to the printhead, facing straight down at the build plate.
   - A sample mount for the **Ender 3** using the BLTouch mount is provided here.
2. **Camera Orientation:**
   - Plug the camera into a phone first to verify orientation. Rotate it **90¬∞ to the left** so that the test pattern lines run from top to bottom in the captured image, maximizing the camera‚Äôs resolution.
3. **Lighting:**
   - Ensure adequate lighting with no significant glare or reflections on the build plate where the test pattern will be printed.
4. **Connect the Camera:**
   - Plug the camera into the printer‚Äôs USB port.

### Software Setup

To set up the software, follow these steps on the printer:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/undingen/PressureAdvanceCamera.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```sh
   cd PressureAdvanceCamera
   ```
3. **Add Your FAL API Key:**
   Create a file named `fal.key` and insert your API key from [fal.ai](https://fal.ai) (used to remove the background of the captured image):
   Make sure to never share this API key with anyone!
   ```sh
   echo "<FAL_KEY>" > fal.key
   ```
4. **Link to Klipper Extras:**
   Create a symbolic link to the Klipper extras directory to add the extension:
   ```sh
   ln -s `pwd`/pressure_advance_camera.py ../klipper/klippy/extras/
   ```
5. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install the `fal-client` package using pip:
   ```sh
   pip3 install fal-client
   ```

### Software Configuration

1. **Crowsnest Check:**
   - Ensure the camera is not being used by crowsnest to avoid conflicts. You may have to comment out the camera section.
2. **Update `printer.cfg`:**
   - Add the following section to your Klipper `printer.cfg` file and cheange the values:
     ```ini
     [pressure_advance_camera]
     camera_offset_x: -23    # X offset from nozzle to camera, negative is left of nozzle
     camera_offset_y: -20    # Y offset from nozzle to camera, negative is in front of nozzle
     photo_height: 50        # Height in mm to position the nozzle for photo. For my cam 5-6cm
     ```
   - If multiple cameras are connected, set the `camera_id` parameter to the appropriate OpenCV camera ID.
3. **Check that the extension:**
   - Check that klipper uses the extensions by executing `HELP` inside the console and looking for GCodes called `DRAW_PRESSURE_ADVANCE_PATTERN` or `SET_PRESSURE_ADVANCE_CAMERA`. If this does not show up make sure you created the symlink and the printer.cfg entry and restart Klipper.

### Default Configuration

The following parameters are pre-configured and only need adjustment if your setup differs from the default (and some like the temperture is best to overwrite directly in the GCode by passing it as argument):

```ini
[pressure_advance_camera]
camera_offset_x:        # X offset from nozzle to camera, negative is left of nozzle
camera_offset_y:        # Y offset from nozzle to camera, negative is infront of nozzle
photo_height:           # Height in mm to position the nozzle for photo - for my cam 5-6cm

script_path: ~/PressureAdvanceCamera/pa_calibrate.py
camera_id: 0            # OpenCV camera ID
x_start: 2              # where to start the pattern
y_start: 2              # where to start the pattern
pa_start: 0.0
pa_end: 0.1
pa_step: 0.005
hotend_temp: 200        # Hotend temperature
bed_temp: 60            # Bed temperature
line_spacing: 3
width: 40
timeout: 600
speed: 100              # Speed for the fast segments
```

### Slicer Settings
For now only tested with OrcaSlicer (but this could ofcourse also be directly done inside the Klipper macros):
- Create a copy of your printers profile but under **Machine start G-Code** prepend this:
```
DRAW_PRESSURE_ADVANCE_PATTERN HOTEND_TEMP=[nozzle_temperature] BED_TEMP=[bed_temperature]
SET_PRESSURE_ADVANCE_CAMERA
```
- Make a copy of you filament profile but **uncheck** "Enable pressure advance" (else the emitted GCode would overwrite auto configed value).

## Software Dependencies

- **fal.ai API Key:**
   - Required for image segmentation due to the challenges of detecting lines with poor lighting and low-quality cameras. The project uses a open **BirefNet model** hosted on fal.ai‚Äôs servers.
   - Costs are minimal (less than **$0.01 per frame/print**), and new users may receive $1 credit upon signing up at [fal.ai](https://fal.ai). *(Note: I have no affiliation with fal.ai and hope I can change the project in the future todo all computation localy.)*
- **Python Packages:**
   - Install `fal-client` as outlined in the installation steps (OpenCV, numpy and Matplotlib should already be installed).

## üêâ Limitation

If the contrast between the build-plate and filament is poor ‚Äî meaning if you as a human cannot reliably detect the best line from the camera image ‚Äî the software will also fail. It's important to have enough light for the camera to take a good picture while also avoiding glare spots that obstruct the view.

## üåê Data Collection for future local model

- All captured images are saved in a subdirectory called **`images`**.
- Users are encouraged to email me the images undingen+pa@gmail.com or upload the images to [this Issue](https://github.com/undingen/PressureAdvanceCamera/issues/1) (after ensuring no private information is included!). This data will help train a smaller, future model that can run directly on the printer. But for this to succeed a lot of different training examples are required...
